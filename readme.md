The application follows these steps to provide responses to your questions:

1. PDF Loading: The app reads multiple PDF documents and extracts their text content.

2. Text Chunking: The extracted text is divided into smaller chunks that can be processed effectively.

3. Language Model: The application utilizes text embeddings to generate vector representations (embeddings) of the text chunks in memory.

4. Similarity Matching: When you ask a question, the app compares it with the text chunks and identifies the most semantically similar ones.

5. Response Generation: The selected chunks are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the relevant content of the PDF.
